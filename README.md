# Central-Bank-Dataset
# Here I merge data from the Kenyan central bank website
I have downloaded kenyan economic data from the Central bank of Kenya website and have merged it using Year and Month to create one
dataset that can be used to learn kenyan econmic performance

in economics Y = C+I+G+X-M
Y = GDP (included)
C = consumption rates in the country
G = Government spending (included)
X-M = Net exports ( also included)
